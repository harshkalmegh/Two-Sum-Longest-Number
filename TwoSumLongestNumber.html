    /**
     * Algorithm
     * 1. create a function which accepts two arguments which are in string
     * 2. handle all edgecases
     * 3. extract the length of both element which is greater loop upto greater element length
     * 4. convert both string into array by split method and reverse both
     * 5. loop first array and then second
     * 6. create a variable to store carry and assign 0 to it
     * 7. add first loop first index element to second loop first index element
     * 8. check if output length is greater than 1 then store first index of string in variable and push second index into empty array
     * 8.1. if not push output into empty array
     * 9. if carry is greater than 0 then push it into the array after the loop
     * 10. reverse the output and join them with join method
     * 11. return the output
